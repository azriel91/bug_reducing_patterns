# Patterns

Largely designed for statically typed languages. These patterns are designed or intended to:

* Favour compile errors over testing through type safety.

    By making it impossible to compile incorrect code, quality is maintained with less tests.

* Reduce mental effort to understand the concept the code is fulfilling.

    Make it easier to understand what the code is doing, to make it easier to spot bugs.


## Disclaimer

As with most patterns, pragmaticism applies.

Applying the concepts excessively may:

* Negatively affect compile time or runtime performance depending on your language.
* Increase the number of files needed to be maintained.
* Cause debate between colleagues, depending on each persons bias.
