# Patterns

Largely designed for statically typed languages &ndash; they rely on having a compiler.

These patterns are designed or intended to:

* Communicate input and output expectations through API.
* Ensure correctness through type safety.

    Only allow an instance of a type to exist, if it meets certain criteria.

* Favour compile time errors over runtime errors.

    By making it impossible to compile incorrect code, correctness and quality is maintained, with fewer tests.
