# Semantic Ambiguity

* Sentinel values:

    - Using `null` to mean "it's not there", or "it's there, but it's empty."
    - Using `-1` to indicate something went wrong.
    - Using `-1` to indicate a variable has not been initialized.

* Data type represents different concepts.

    - If you want X, define fields **A**, **B**, and **C**.
    - If you want Y, define fields **A**, **B**, **D**, and **E**.
